Subject: [PATCH] Don't apply de-synced opencount for shulker boxes

Would bug out when opening a shulker box multiple times in a tick, caused by ping or fast clicking.

The issue is caused by how block events in minecraft work. Just commenting this line out prevents
the wrong data from being set - there isn't a reason to do this on the server anyway.
